Liskov Substitution Principle

> DCB : Both parent and child of an object, should be interchangeable; whenever we pass the child (or vice-versa the
> parent), it should work without breaking the code.

> JavaTechie : It applies to inheritance in such a way that the derived classes must
> be completely substitutable for their base classes. In other words, if
> class A is a subtype of class B, then we should be able to replace B
> with A without interrupting the behaviour of the program.
