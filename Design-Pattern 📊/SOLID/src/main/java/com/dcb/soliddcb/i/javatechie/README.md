Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

The principle states that the larger interfaces
split into smaller ones. Because the
implementation classes use only the methods
that are required. We should not force the
client to use the methods that they do not
want to use.

The goal of the interface segregation principle
is similar to the single responsibility principle.
Let's understand the principle through an
example.
