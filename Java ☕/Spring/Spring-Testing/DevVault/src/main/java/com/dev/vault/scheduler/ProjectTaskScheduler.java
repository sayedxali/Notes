/**
 * This class schedules the marking of overdue tasks and sends notifications.<br>
 * The method "markTaskOverDue" runs every 10 minutes and iterates over all tasks in the database with a status of "IN_PROGRESS".<br>
 * If a task is overdue, its status is updated to "OVERDUE", its "hasOverdue" flag is set to true, and its "completionDate" is set to the current date and time.<br>
 * The method also sends a notification to the task assignee that the task is overdue (TODO).<br>
 * <p>
 * To change the scheduling time, use the following pattern:<br>
 * second, minute, hour, day, month, weekday.<br>
 * Examples of different scheduling patterns include:<br>
 * <p>
 * 1. "@Scheduled(cron = '0 0 18,21,0 * * *')": runs every day at 6:00 PM, 9:00 PM, and 12:00 AM.<br>
 * 2. "@Scheduled(cron = '0 0 0 * * *')": runs every day at midnight.<br>
 * 3. "@Scheduled(cron = '0 0 6-9 * * *')": runs every day at 6:00 AM, 7:00 AM, 8:00 AM, and 9:00 AM.<br>
